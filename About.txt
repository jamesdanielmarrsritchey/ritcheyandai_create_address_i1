Notes:
 - This project was developed in part by using the tool GitHub Copilot Business.
 - I only know some basics of C++, so vet the code before attempting to use/run it! For me, making this project was more about learning how to use AI tools than the actual project itself.
 - This program is considered experimental at this stage, so don't be surprised if it doesn't work correctly. It's also currently incomplete.
